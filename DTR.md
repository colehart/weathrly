#### How to overcome obstacles:
- Face-to-face conversation if possible
- Slack call if face-to-face not practical
- Slack text as a last resort

#### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
###### Dina
- Weekend:

  * Saturday: Prefer face-to-face, not from Turing if we don't need to be. Let's start working at 10am. Stop when it makes sense to. Lunch break is also cool.

  * Sunday: Face-to-face, but less time than Saturday. Be on Slack afterwards as needed.

- Weekday: Can come in 7:30-8a. Stay til 4p. Slack after 5:30p.

- Lunch: Working is cool as long as we don't have pairings.

###### Cole
- Weekend:

  * Saturday: Turing or elsewhere by 10am. Stay till 4-5pm. We can decide about Sunday face-to-face or remote at EOD.

  * Sunday: Remote for as much as possible. Be on Slack by 10am for a call to check-in and then decide to work over Slack on call or via Slack text.

- Weekday: Can come in as early as 7:30-8:15a. Stay til 6. Can be on Slack at 8pm if necessary. Unavailable Thursday evening.

- Lunch: Working is cool unless we're pairing.

#### Communication Expectations (How and how often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
- Daily check-ins - am, lunch, pm.

- Face-to-face conversation if possible
- Slack call if face-to-face not practical
- Slack text as a last resort

#### Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
- Expect to ask each other first to solve technical problems in order to leverage each others' different strengths and level each other up before reaching out to others for help.

- When pairing, bring partner if possible/practical.

#### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
- Dina wants to research Sass and implement that as early as possible, working knowledge of how React Components interact.
- Cole wants to work as hard as possible in the beginning to lay a commonly understood foundation for us to be able to branch off on different features as soon as possible.

#### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
- Follow the recommended Git Workflow
- New branches per phase
- new branches per phased feature if it's significant.
- if working separately on different code, use our names to signify whose code is whose for merge conflict resolution future-proofing
- Originator never merges pull request
- When PR is made, send Slack message to partner for peer review
- Use Waffle.io to manage the project

#### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
- Face-to-face conversation if possible
- Slack call if face-to-face not practical
- Slack text as a last resort

#### Agenda to discuss project launch:
- work through DTR template
- Cole show Waffle.io to Dina
- set up waffle.io for project
- walk through completeMe code

#### Ideas:

#### Tools:
- Waffle.io
- Slack
- GitHub
